# LIPAS™ – Liveness-Based Personalized Authorization System

LIPAS™ is a research-oriented and patent-pending security architecture
designed to explore next-generation authorization models that extend
beyond classical credentials and device-bound authentication.

The system focuses on **liveness verification**, **biologically bound identity**,
and **safe-state security behavior** under physical or electromagnetic interference.

## What is LIPAS?

LIPAS investigates how authorization can be:
- Non-transferable
- Biologically bound to a living human
- Resistant to coercion, replay, and physical manipulation

Unlike traditional systems that rely solely on stored secrets or devices,
LIPAS evaluates **real-time physiological and behavioral signals**
to determine whether authorization should remain active.

## Core Research Concepts

- **Liveness Verification**  
  Detection of authentic biological activity rather than static biometric patterns.

- **Safe-State Inactivation**  
  Automatic transition to an inactive, non-exploitable state under:
  - Physical interference
  - Electromagnetic anomalies
  - Stress or abnormal physiological patterns

- **Non-Transferable Authorization**  
  Authorization signals cannot be copied, replayed, or delegated.

## System Behavior Overview

1. An authorization request is initiated via a secure system (e.g. QUNET).
2. LIPAS evaluates liveness and physiological integrity.
3. If authorization is confirmed, a verified signal may propagate to the system.
4. If integrity is compromised, LIPAS enters a **safe inactive state**.
5. No authorization signal is emitted in inactive mode.

## Relationship to Other Research Initiatives

- **QUNET**  
  A conceptual research framework exploring quantum-inspired secure communication.

- **QUP / QUPAY**  
  Visual and conceptual representations of trust or authorization signal flow.

LIPAS operates independently and does **not** represent a payment system,
financial instrument, or commercial authorization service.
